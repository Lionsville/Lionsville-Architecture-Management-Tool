/**
 * The shipped examples, checked as data.
 *
 * A container diagram nests its components inside the application boundary, and
 * the one thing that makes that happen is `parentApplicationId` — Tidy builds the
 * boundary as a compound node whose children are exactly the components parented
 * to it (`tidyContainer`), and everything else on the diagram is context placed
 * around it. A component that names no parent is therefore not "missing a
 * field": it is laid out beside the box it belongs in, and the example that is
 * meant to show what a container view looks like shows the opposite.
 *
 * Nothing but a reader's eye was checking that, and an example is the first
 * thing anyone opens.
