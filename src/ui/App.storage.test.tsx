 * The session that leaves nothing behind, and says so.
 *
 * When browser storage refuses at boot the composition swaps in memory stores.
 * Everything then works — and nothing survives the tab. Because those stores
 * never fail, `useStorageNotice` is never called and the user was told
 * precisely nothing; they would find out on the next morning's first coffee.
 *
 * A standing notice rather than a toast: it is true for the whole session, not
 * an event within it.
